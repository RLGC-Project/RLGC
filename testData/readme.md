## 39 bus system data
 **File naming convention**: the number at the end of the files means the change percentage compared to the base case, the meaning of the changes are as follows:
 - the first four files are defined such that the portion of power represented by ac motors for four buses 504, 507, 508, and 518 are different, but the bus total loads are the same
 - the second four files are for power flow cases where the loads at **the four buses (504, 507, 508, and 518)** are changed 
 - the last four files are for power flow cases where the loads at **ALL** buses are changed
